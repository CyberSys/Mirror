Our Shooter Example aims to replicate fast paced first person shooter games like Quake & Counter-Strike,
by utilizing Mirror's advanced features:

- Snapshot Interpolation
- Lag Compensation
- Client Side Prediction
- Two Click Hosting

The goal is to provide a lightweight demo that users can learn from.
All the complicated magic should be hidden in Mirror Components, with minimal custom code.
We want users to understand this easily and implement it in their own projects with very little effort.
